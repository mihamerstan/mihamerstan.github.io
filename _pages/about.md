I am a Masters student at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/about/) at New York University. I am applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2021. I work in the research groups of [Prof. Debra Laefer](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/debra-laefer) and [Prof. Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/). My specific research interests are spatial data, machine learning, inverse problems, and the intersection thereof.
